FMCW Radar - Signal Processing and Hardware

The goal is to find the RTI (Range vs. Time Intensity) and DTI (Doppler vs. Time Intensity) images.
For RTI and DTI; the stop and start frequencies and all the other necessary parameters for the device are given in the ''.py'' files.
This project were inspired by the radar project of the MIT LL.
